## Get answers to all operational questions about your applications.

As cloud based applications and microservice architectures become the new normal, new challenges are surfacing: highly dynamic application environments with millions of dependencies and trillions of events per day require a new approach to monitoring.

Dynatrace Ruxit helps you manage the unmanageable:

- Our *[smartscape technology](/en/ruxit/capabilities/why-ruxit/smartscape-visualization/)* arms CIOs and their teams to track the performance of business applications throughout the entire technology stack.
- See *all relevant metrics*, environment changes, and application deployments *in real-time and out-of-the-box*.
- Don’t lose valuable time locating problems: our artificial intelligence finds them for you and pinpoints the underlying root cause in seconds.

## Discover what you can’t know!

It’s become increasingly difficult to manage the rapidly scaling environments and continuous delivery of new functionality.  In particular, the rise of *[microservices and containers](/en/ruxit/capabilities/microservices/)* has increased the complexity of dependencies between application components.

Dynatrace Ruxit *auto-detects the dependencies* throughout the *[full stack](/en/ruxit/capabilities/full-stack-monitoring/)*: website, back end application, services, containers, hosts, network, and cloud infrastructure:

- Dynatrace Ruxit automatically recognizes and visualizes your web application architecture *end-to-end*.
- Install a single agent and get started in minutes: *no configuration required*, it just works.

## AI-powered monitoring is an investment into customer satisfaction.
Most modern monitoring tools still require manual steps to resolve problems. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of human operators, this isn’t an approach that scales up well within large environments. It is a time-consuming manual process putting you at risk of losing customers.

[Artificial intelligence technology](/en/ruxit/capabilities/why-ruxit/artificial-intelligence/) tells you where and why applications break down by processing billions of events per day:

- Dynatrace Ruxit automatically learns how your application is supposed to perform and *detects anomalies* before your customers are effected.
- Stop hunting for problems and just fix them: Dynatrace Ruxit *pinpoints the root cause of problems* in seconds by analyzing millions of dependencies within your environment.

# Get to the root cause quickly
Gain immediate insight into problems with a brief overview of impacted applications, user actions, and components.

Using AI algorithms and comprehensive data analytics, Ruxit detects which components are causing problems. Ruxit does this by collecting all required data using proprietary agent technology that pulls performance data from cloud instances, hosts, processes, and services. Ruxit is able to deliver deep data analytics and detect causal relationships between performance data points with millions of dependencies. Ruxit saves you the effort of interpreting such dependent events on your own and directs you to the component that’s causing the problem.
